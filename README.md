# Turing_Machine
A turing machine simulator run in the console. 
## What is a turing machine?
A turing machine is a type of computer, theorised by Alan Turing in 1936. Although simple, it is capable of computing anything a modern computer could compute today. Using only 3 symbols, 0s, 1s and blanks, and a table of states and instructions, the turing machine is technically capable of running GTA5 (Albeit extremely slowly).

## How to use
The turing machine will run whatever code is in the code.vno file. If you run the turing executable, a console window will pop up with a simulation of the machine. To advance onto the next step, press the enter key. You can hold the enter key to advance through the steps quickly. You can also enter a 'q' into the input field, which will terminate the program.
